# Custom OAuth Provider

<Callout>
  You might not need to create a custom OAuth provider. Make sure you check the
  [list of our official OAuth providers](/getting-started/authentication#setup-oauth)
  before you create one.
</Callout>

You can use _any_ provider as long as they are compliant with the [OAuth/OIDC specifications](https://openid.net/developers/specs/). Auth.js uses the [`oauth4webapi`](https://github.com/panva/oauth4webapi/blob/main/docs/README.md) package under the hood.

To use a custom OAuth provider with Auth.js, pass an object to the [`providers` list](/reference/core#providers).

It can implement either the [`OAuth2Config`](/reference/core/providers#oauth2configprofile) or the [`OIDCConfig`](/reference/core/providers#oidcconfigprofile) interface, depending on if your provider is **OAuth 2** or **OpenID Connect** compliant.

For example, if you have a fully OIDC-compliant provider, this is all you need:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
// Note that for types to work you will need to install the `@auth/core` package
import type { OIDCConfig } from "@auth/core/providers";

export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
  auth,
} = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    {
      id: "my-provider",
      name: "My Provider",
      type: "oidc",
      issuer: "https://my.oidc-provider.com",
      clientId: process.env.AUTH_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET,
    } satisfies OIDCConfig,
  ],
});
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

Then, you can set the [callback URL](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-07.html#name-client-redirection-endpoint) in your provider's dashboard to something like `https://app-url.com/auth/api/callback/my-provider`.

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that when setting the callback URL in your provider's dashboard, it'll
  have this shape: ``` [origin]/[framework_path]/callback/[provider_id] ``` The
  `framework_path` segment will be `/api/auth` for Next.js, and `auth` in other
  frameworks. `provider_id` is what you set as `id` in the `auth.ts` config file
  above.
</Callout>

## Publishing your provider as a built-in provider

If you think your custom provider might be useful to others, we encourage you to open a PR and add it to the built-in list.

<Callout type="warning">
  We are only accepting new providers to `@auth/core`, and not `next-auth`.
  Follow the steps below to make sure your PR is merged!
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Creating the provider's file

Create a new `{provider}.ts` (for it to get merged, you must use TypeScript) file under the [`packages/core/src/providers`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/packages/core/src/providers) directory.

### Adhere to our code conventions

Taking the already defined providers as a guide, make sure your provider adheres to the same code conventions, .i.e:

- Use a named default export: `export default function YourProvider`
- Export the TypeScript `interface` that defines the provider's available user info properties
- Add the necessary JSDoc comments/documentation (Study the built-in providers to get an understanding what's needed. For example, the [Auth0 provider](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/auth0.ts) is a good example for OIDC and the [GitHub Provider](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/github.ts) is an OAuth provider.)
- Add links to the provider's API reference/documentation so others can understand how to use the provider

### Add your provider name in Github issues dropdown

Add the new provider name to the `Provider type` dropdown options in [`the provider issue template`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/edit/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2_bug_provider.yml)

### Add a logo for your provider

Add a logo `{provider}.svg` to the [`docs/static/img/providers`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/docs/static/img/providers) directory.

</Steps>

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Others will be able to discover and use this provider!
