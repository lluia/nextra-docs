# Custom sign in page

Auth.js comes by default with a set of pages that are presented to the user as they go through their authentication journey (sign up, sign in, sign out, error, etc...). This is helpful so that you don't need to write those from scratch when using the library first time.

For example, in [the example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example), if you click on "Sign in":

import ExampleApp from "../../../public/img/tutorials/example-app.webp"

<Screenshot src={ExampleApp} alt="Example App" />

or build your own button component which calls the `signIn` helper, and then click it:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```tsx filename="components/sign-in.tsx"
import { signIn } from "../auth.ts";

export function SignInButton() {
  return <button onClick={}>Sign in</button>;
}
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

you'll then be presented with Auth.js built-in sign in page:

import SignInPage from "../../../public/img/tutorials/sign-in-page.webp"

<Screenshot src={SignInPage} alt="Sign-in Page" />

In this case the app has been configured with [GithubProvider](/) and [CredentialsProvider](/) (so either sign in with Github or insert username and password), hence the sign in page shows both options.

If we added the [GoogleProvider](/) to our Auth.js config file (`./auth.ts`), then a 3rd option to sign in with Google would be available, and so on as we add more providers.

While this page is helpful, you might want customise its layout and styles to match better your application branding and have smoother user journey. We can add so with the [`pages`](/) configuration option:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```tsx filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github";
import Credentials from "next-auth/providers/credentials";
import type { NextAuthConfig } from "next-auth";

export const config = {
  theme: {
    logo: "https://next-auth.js.org/img/logo/logo-sm.png",
  },
  providers: [GitHub, Credentials],
  pages: {
    // You need to make sure that the Sign In page actually exists! (.i.e app/signin/page.tsx)
    signIn: "/signin",
  },
} satisfies NextAuthConfig;

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth(config);
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

We can now build our own custom sign in page:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```tsx filename="app/signin/page.tsx"
// make sure your config object is exported so that you can read the configured providers (config.providers)!
import { signIn, config, auth } from "../../../auth.ts";
import { icons } from "../../../components/icons";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

async function getSession() {
  const session = await auth();

  return {
    session,
  };
}

export default async function SignInPage() {
  const { session } = await getSession();

  // The user is already logged in, redirect to homepage.
  // Make sure is not the same URL to avoid an infinite loop!
  if (session) return redirect("/");

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 max-w-80 mx-auto justify-center h-screen">
      {Object.values(config.providers).map((provider) => (
        <form action={provider.authorisation.url} method="POST">
          <Button className="flex flex-row gap-2" type="submit">
            <span>
              {icons[provider.name]} Sign in with {provider.name}
            </span>
          </Button>
        </form>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

Then when clicking on "Sign in" on the app (calling `signIn`), our custom sign in page will appear with the available sign in options:

import CustomSignInPage from "../../../public/img/tutorials/custom-sign-in-page.webp"

<Screenshot
  src={CustomSignInPage}
  alt="Custom Sign-in Page"
  className="w-full max-w-3xl"
/>
