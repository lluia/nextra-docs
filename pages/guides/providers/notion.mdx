# Notion Provider

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_NOTION_ID
AUTH_NOTION_SECRET
AUTH_NOTION_REDIRECT_URI
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Notion from "next-auth/providers/notion";

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Notion({
      clientId: process.env.AUTH_NOTION_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH_NOTION_SECRET,
      redirectUri: process.env.AUTH_NOTION_REDIRECT_URI,
    }),
  ],
});
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit";
import Notion from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/notion";
import {
  AUTH_NOTION_ID,
  AUTH_NOTION_SECRET,
  AUTH_NOTION_REDIRECT_URI,
} from "$env/static/private";

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = SvelteKitAuth(request, {
  providers: [
    Notion({
      clientId: AUTH_NOTION_ID,
      clientSecret: AUTH_NOTION_SECRET,
      redirectUri: AUTH_NOTION_REDIRECT_URI,
    }),
  ],
});
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express";
import Notion from "@auth/express/providers/notion";

app.use(
  "/auth/*",
  ExpressAuth({
    providers: [
      Notion({
        clientId: process.env.AUTH_NOTION_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.AUTH_NOTION_SECRET,
        redirectUri: process.env.AUTH_NOTION_REDIRECT_URI,
      }),
    ],
  })
);
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

## Notes

You need to select "Public Integration" on the configuration page to get an `oauth_id` and `oauth_secret`. Private integrations do not provide these details.
You must provide a `clientId` and `clientSecret` to use this provider, as-well as a redirect URI (due to this being required by Notion endpoint to fetch tokens).

<Callout>

The Notion provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/notion.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
