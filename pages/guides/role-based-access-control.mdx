# Role-based access control

There are two ways to add [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) to your application with Auth.js, based on the [session strategy](/concepts/session-strategies) you choose. Let's see an example for each of these.

## Getting the role

Start by adding a `profile()` callback to the providers' config to determine the user role:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Google({
      profile(profile) {
        return { role: profile.role ?? "user", ... }
      },
      ...
    })
  ],
})
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

<Callout>
  To determine the user's role, you can either add your logic or if your
  provider assigns roles already, use that instead.
</Callout>

## Persisting the role

Persisting the role will be different depending on the [session strategy](/concepts/session-strategies) you're using. If you don't know which session strategy you're using, then most likely you're using JWT (the default one).

### With JWT

When you don't have a database configured, the role will be persisted in a cookie, by using the `jwt()` callback. On sign-in, the `role` property is exposed from the `profile` callback on the `user` object. Persist the `user.role` value by assigning it to `token.role`. That's it!

If you also want to use the role on the client, you can expose it via the `session` callback.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Google({
      profile(profile) {
        return { role: profile.role ?? "user", ... }
      },
      ...
    })
  ],
  callbacks: {
    jwt({ token, user }) {
      if(user) token.role = user.role
      return token
    },
    session({ session, token }) {
      session.user.role = token.role
      return session
    }
  }
})
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

<Callout type="info">
  With this strategy, if you want to update the role, the user needs to be
  forced to sign in again.
</Callout>

### With Database

When you have a database, you can save the user role on the [User model](/reference/core/adapters#adapteruser). The below example is showing you how to do this with Prisma, but the idea is the same for all adapters.

First, add a `role` column to the User model.

```ts filename="/prisma/schema.prisma"
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String?   @unique
  emailVerified DateTime?
  image         String?
  role          String?  // New column
  accounts      Account[]
  sessions      Session[]
}
```

The `profile()` callback's return value is used to create users in the database. That's it! Your newly created users will now have an assigned role.

If you also want to use the role on the client, you can expose it via the `session` callback.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"
import prisma from "lib/prisma"

export default NextAuth({
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  providers: [
    Google({
      profile(profile) {
        return { role: profile.role ?? "user", ... }
      }
      ...
    })
  ],
  callbacks: {
    session({ session, user }) {
      session.user.role = user.role
      return session
    }
  }
})
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

<Callout type="info">
  It is up to you how you want to manage to update the roles, either through
  direct database access or building your role update API.
</Callout>

## Using the role

If you want to use the role in the client, for both cases above, when using the `useSession` hook, `session.user.role` will have the required role if you exposed it via the `session` callback. You can use this to render a different UI for different users.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./app/admin/page.tsx"
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";

export default function Page() {
  const session = await useSession();

  if (session?.user.role === "admin") {
    return <p>You are an admin, welcome!</p>;
  }

  return <p>You are not authorized to view this page!</p>;
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

<Callout>
  When using Next.js and JWT, you can alternatively also use
  [Middleware](/getting-started/securing/middleware#redirecting-users) to redirect the user
  based on their role, even before rendering the page.
</Callout>
