# Magic links authentication with Nodemailer

Thanks to Auth.js, aside from authenticating users in your app via [OAuth](/setup/oauth-authentication), you can also allow users to authenticate via "magic links".

Magic links ü™Ñ are links that are sent to the user's email. When the user clicks on them, they'll be redirect to your Auth.js app and be automatically logged in (as long as the link is still valid).

<Callout>
  Adding login via magic links in addition to one or more OAuth services allows
  users to always be able to login in your app even if they lose access to their
  OAuth account (e.g. their Google account is locked or deleted).
</Callout>

## How it works

On initial sign in, a **Verification Token** is sent to the email address provided by the user. By default this token **is valid for 24 hours**. If the verification token is used within that time (by clicking on the link in the email) an account is created for the user (if they did not had one yet) and they are signed in.

<Callout type="info">
  The Email Provider can be used with both JSON Web Tokens and database
  sessions, but you [must configure a database
  adapter](/getting-started/database) to use it. It is not possible to enable
  email sign in without using a database.
</Callout>

## Overview

<Steps>

### Installing Auth.js

Initial installation of Auth.js and Next.js

### Setting up a SMTP service

We need to set up an SMTP service so that we can send emails containing sign in links to the user's email. For this tutorial we will be using [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-api/).

### Setting up a database adapter

A database adapter is required for setting magic links. We need to store the verification tokens so that we can verify them when users come back to the app after clicking on the sign in link present in the email.

### Wiring all together

Finally, we'll need to wire all together to make Auth.js `EmailProvider` work with Next.js.

</Steps>

## Installing Auth.js & Next.js

For this tutorial, we're gonna use the default [Auth.js & Next.js example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example). If you already have an existing Next.js app, it should work too. If you haven't, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git && cd next-auth-example
```

If you're using the example app, Auth.js is already installed, otherwise follow the [installation instructions](/installation).

## Setting up a SMTP service

[`nodemailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) is a [peer dependency](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) when using Auth.js `EmailProvider`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -D nodemailer
```

`nodemailer` will enable us to send emails from NodeJS, the runtime on which Next.js application operates.

What also need a [SMTP service](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) which will be in charge of sending emails to the user from our application. There's a number of options available for this, however [here are the ones](https://community.nodemailer.com/2-0-0-beta/setup-smtp/well-known-services) known to work with `nodemailer`.

<Callout>
  For this tutorial, we're going to be using [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/),
  but any of the services linked should require a similar setup.
</Callout>

First, create an account in Sendgrid. Then login to Sendgrid's dashboard and navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**. Lets create a new API key. Once created, store it in a safe place.

import DashboardSmtp from "../../public/img/magic-links/dashboard-smtp.webp";

<Screenshot src={DashboardSmtp} alt="SendGrid Dashboard" />

### Configuring Auth.js

Next, as [per Sendgrid
documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/integrating-with-the-smtp-api),
let's add the following [environment variables](https://next.js.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) in our Next.js app:

```bash filename=".env.local"
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD={API_KEY}
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_FROM={SENDER_EMAIL}
```

Note that we're also specifying from which domain emails are going to be sent from. You're going to need to verify [your sender's identity](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity) so that Sendgrid can send emails from the specified email domain. For simplicity, we recommend using a Gmail account.

Finally, we need to expose this configuration values to Auth.js `EmailProvider`, which is the provider in charge of making magic links work:

<Tabs items={["App router", "Pages router"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Email from "next-auth/providers/email";
 
export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Email({
      server: {
        host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
        port: Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT),
        auth: {
          user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
          pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD,
        },
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
    }),
  ],
});
```
```ts filename="app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts"
export { GET, POST } from "./auth";
export const runtime = "edge"; // optional
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Email from "next-auth/providers/email";
 
export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Email({
      server: {
        host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
        port: Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT),
        auth: {
          user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
          pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD,
        },
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
    }),
  ],
});
```
```ts filename="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts"
export { GET, POST } from "./auth";
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting up an adapter

We now need to setup a [database adapter](/reference/adapters), to store the verification tokens the `EmailProvider` will emit when verifying users.

For this tutorial, we're going to use the [MongoDB Adapter](/reference/adapter/mongodb), but any of the other adapters should work just fine.

Let's start by installing the adapter package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -D  @auth/mongodb-adapter mongodb
```

and create a simple MongoDB client:

```ts filename="lib/mongodb/client.ts"
// This approach is taken from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mongodb
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI;
const options = {
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  useNewUrlParser: true,
};

let client;
let clientPromise;

if (!process.env.MONGODB_URI) {
  throw new Error("Please add your Mongo URI to .env.local");
}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  // In development mode, use a global variable so that the value
  // is preserved across module reloads caused by HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
  if (!global._mongoClientPromise) {
    client = new MongoClient(uri, options);
    global._mongoClientPromise = client.connect();
  }
  clientPromise = global._mongoClientPromise;
} else {
  // In production mode, it's best to not use a global variable.
  client = new MongoClient(uri, options);
  clientPromise = client.connect();
}

// Export a module-scoped MongoClient promise. By doing this in a
// separate module, the client can be shared across functions.
export clientPromise;
```

And lets reference this new adapter from our Auth.js configuration file:

```diff filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Email from "next-auth/providers/email"
+ import { MongoDBAdapter } from "@auth/mongodb-adapter"
+ import { clientPromise } from "./lib/mongodb/client"

export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
+ adapter: MongoDBAdapter(clientPromise),
  providers: [
    Email({
      server: {
        host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
        port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
        }
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Wiring all together

Now that everything is properly configured, let's try to sign in via magic links in our application.

Start the Next.js app:

```
npm run next dev
```

And navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). Click on "Sign in" and you should see the sign in page:

import MagicLinkStart from "../../public/img/magic-links/start.webp";

<Screenshot src={MagicLinkStart} alt="Screenshot of sign in page" />

<Callout type="info">
  You can customize the look and feel of your Sign in page pretty easily with
  Auth.js. Refer to our guide for that!
</Callout>

Then insert the email address we want to sign in with in the "Email" section and click on "Sign in with Email". Auth.js will then display another page hinting us to check our email:

import MagicLinkCheck from "../../public/img/magic-links/check.webp";

<Screenshot src={MagicLinkCheck} alt="Screenshot of check email page" />

Lets go to our mailbox, and look for an email sent from Auth.hjs (check your spam folder üìÅ just in case):

import Mailbox from "../../public/img/magic-links/mailbox.webp";

<Screenshot src={Mailbox} alt="Screenshot of mailbox" />

We got one from the sender specified in the `EMAIL_FROM` environment variable we set up earleir.

Click on "Sign in", a new browser tab should open, landing in our application already authenticated:

import Logged from "../../public/img/magic-links/logged.webp";

<Screenshot src={Logged} alt="Screenshot of logged in" />

<Callout type="info">
  A user account (i.e. an entry in the `User` table) will not be created for the
  user until the first time they verify their email address. If an email address
  is already associated with an account, the user will be signed in to that
  account when they use the link in the email.
</Callout>
