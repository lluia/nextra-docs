# Choosing authentication method(s)

<Callout type="warning">
  Auth.js discourages the use of passwords due to the inherent security risks of
  the username-password model. Passwords are still supported through the
  <strong>CredentialsProvider</strong> but we strongly encourage to setup a combination
  of Oauth and Passwordless for authentication.
</Callout>

Before start setting up Auth.js, you need to decide how you're gonna authenticate users in your application. Auth.js supports three main authentication paradigms:

- **OAuth** ( _Sign in with Google, Github, LinkedIn, etc..._ )
- **Paswordless** ( _Magic links, OTP codes, WebAuthn, etc..._ )
- **External Auth** ( _Integrating with external APIs, etc..._ )

<b>OAuth is the recommended authentication method for your application</b>

OAuth providers spend significant amounts of money, time, and engineering effort to build abuse detection ( _bot-protection, rate-limiting_ ), password management ( _password reset, credential stuffing, rotation_ ), data security ( _encryption/salting, strength validation_ ), and much more. It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.
