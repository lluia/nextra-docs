# Installing Auth.js

This tutorial assumes you have a Next.js application set up. If you don't, you can follow the [Next.js tutorial](https://Next.js.org/learn/basics/create-Next.js-app) to get started. Installing Auth.js is easy, just run:

```bash npm2yarnbun
npm install next-auth
```

## Environment

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your application and add the `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable:

```bash filename=".env.local"
AUTH_SECRET="This is an example"
```

`AUTH_SECRET` is a random string used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes, and it's mandatory to keep things secure (See [Deployment](/deployment) for more details). On Unix based systems you can use this command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

or https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 to generate a random value for it.
