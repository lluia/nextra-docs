# TikTok Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/tiktok
```

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_TIKTOK_ID
AUTH_TIKTOK_SECRET
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import TikTok from "next-auth/providers/tiktok";

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [TikTok],
});
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit";
import TikTok from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/tiktok";

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = SvelteKitAuth(request, {
  providers: [TikTok],
});
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express";
import TikTok from "@auth/express/providers/tiktok";

app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({ providers: [TikTok] }));
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Notes

Production applications cannot use localhost URLs to sign in with Tiktok. You need add the domain and Callback/Redirect url's to your Tiktok app and have them review and approved by the Tiktok Team.

<Callout type="warning">

Email address is not supported by Tiktok.

Client_ID will be the Client Key in the Tiktok Application

By default, Auth.js assumes that the Tiktok provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout>
The Tiktok provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/tiktok.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
