# Instagram Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/instagram
```

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_INSTAGRAM_ID
AUTH_INSTAGRAM_SECRET
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Instagram from "next-auth/providers/instagram";

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [Instagram],
});
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit";
import Instagram from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/instagram";

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = SvelteKitAuth(request, {
  providers: [Instagram],
});
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express";
import Instagram from "@auth/express/providers/instagram";

app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({ providers: [Instagram] }));
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the Instagram provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout type="warning">
  Email address is not returned by the Instagram API.
</Callout>

Instagram display app required callback URL to be configured in your Facebook app and Facebook required you to use **https** even for localhost! In order to do that, you either need to [add an SSL to your localhost](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-https-working-on-your-local-development-environment-in-5-minutes-7af615770eec/) or use a proxy such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs).

<Callout>
  The Instagram provider comes with a [default
  configuration](https://instagram.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/instagram.ts).
  To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in
  OAuth
  provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).
</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/instagram-discussions).
