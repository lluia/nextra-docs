# Pinterest Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/pinterest
```

### Configuration

```js
import Auth from "@auth/core";
import Pinterest from "@auth/core/providers/pinterest";

const request = new Request(origin);
const response = await Auth(request, {
  providers: [
    Pinterest({
      clientId: PINTEREST_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: PINTEREST_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Resources

- [Pinterest OAuth documentation](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/authentication/)
- [Pinterest app console](https://developers.pinterest.com/apps/)

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the Pinterest provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout type="info">

To use in production, make sure the app has standard API access and not trial access

</Callout>

<Callout>

The Pinterest provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/pinterest.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
