# Twitter Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/twitter
```

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_TWITTER_ID
AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Twitter from "next-auth/providers/twitter";

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [Twitter],
});
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit";
import Twitter from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/twitter";

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = SvelteKitAuth(request, {
  providers: [Twitter],
});
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express";
import Twitter from "@auth/express/providers/twitter";

app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({ providers: [Twitter] }));
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

## OAuth 2

Twitter supports OAuth 2, which is currently opt-in. To enable it, simply add version: "2.0" to your Provider configuration:

```js filename="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
TwitterProvider({
  clientId: process.env.TWITTER_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.TWITTER_SECRET,
  version: "2.0", // opt-in to Twitter OAuth 2.0
});
```

Keep in mind that although this change is easy, it changes how and with which of Twitter APIs you can interact with. Read the official Twitter OAuth 2 documentation for more details.

<Callout type="warning">

Email is currently not supported by Twitter OAuth 2.0.

</Callout>

### Notes

Twitter is currently the only built-in provider using the OAuth 1.0 spec.
This means that you won't receive an `access_token` or `refresh_token`, but an `oauth_token` and `oauth_token_secret` respectively. Remember to add these to your database schema, in case if you are using an [Adapter](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/adapters).

<Callout type="info">
You must enable the "Request email address from users" option in your app permissions if you want to obtain the users email address.

</Callout>

By default, Auth.js assumes that the Twitter provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout>

The Twitter provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/twitter.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
