# Credentials Provider

## Setup

Gives full control over how you handle the credentials received from the user.

The Credentials provider allows you to handle signing in with arbitrary credentials,
such as a username and password, domain, or two factor authentication or hardware device (e.g. YubiKey U2F / FIDO).

It is intended to support use cases where you have an existing system you need to authenticate users against.

It comes with the constraint that users authenticated in this manner are not persisted in the database,
and consequently that the Credentials provider can only be used if JSON Web Tokens are enabled for sessions.

<Callout type="warning">
The functionality provided for credentials-based authentication is intentionally limited to discourage the use of passwords due to the inherent security risks of the username-password model.

OAuth providers spend significant amounts of money, time, and engineering effort to build:

- abuse detection (bot-protection, rate-limiting)
- password management (password reset, credential stuffing, rotation)
- data security (encryption/salting, strength validation)

and much more for authentication solutions. It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.

If you'd still like to build password-based authentication for your application despite these risks, Auth.js gives you full control to do so.

<Callout type="warning">
  There is no validation on the user inputs by default, so make sure you do so
  by a popular library like [Zod](https://zod.dev)
</Callout>

See the [callbacks documentation](/reference/core#authconfig#callbacks) for more information on how to interact with the token. For example, you can add additional information to the token by returning an object from the `jwt()` callback:

```js
callbacks: {
  async jwt({ token, user, account, profile, isNewUser }) {
    if (user) {
      token.id = user.id
    }
    return token
  }
}
```
