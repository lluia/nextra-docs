# Descope Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/descope
```

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_DESCOPE_ID
AUTH_DESCOPE_SECRET
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Descope from "next-auth/providers/descope";

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [Descope],
});
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit";
import Descope from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/descope";

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = SvelteKitAuth(request, {
  providers: [Descope],
});
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express";
import Descope from "@auth/express/providers/descope";

app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({ providers: [Descope] }));
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Configuring Descope

Follow these steps:

1. Log into the [Descope console](https://app.descope.com)
2. Follow the [OIDC instructions](https://docs.descope.com/customize/auth/oidc)

Then, create a `.env.local` file in the project root add the following entries:

Get the following from the Descope's console:

```
DESCOPE_ID="<Descope Issuer's last url segment>" # Descope's Issuer can be found in "Authentication Methods > SSO > Identity Provider" (Can also be taken from "Project > Project ID")
DESCOPE_SECRET="<Descope Access Key>" # Manage > Access Keys
```

### Notes

The Descope provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/descope.ts). To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

<Callout type="info">
  By default, Auth.js assumes that the Descope provider is based on the
  [OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) spec
</Callout>

## Help

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
