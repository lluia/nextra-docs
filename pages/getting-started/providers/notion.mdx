# Notion Provider

## Setup

```ts
import { Auth } from "@auth/core";
import Notion from "@auth/core/providers/notion";

const request = new Request(origin);
const response = await Auth(request, {
  providers: [
    Notion({
      clientId: NOTION_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET,
      redirectUri: NOTION_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URI,
    }),
  ],
});
```

- [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)

## Notes

You need to select "Public Integration" on the configuration page to get an `oauth_id` and `oauth_secret`. Private integrations do not provide these details.
You must provide a `clientId` and `clientSecret` to use this provider, as-well as a redirect URI (due to this being required by Notion endpoint to fetch tokens).

<Callout>

The Notion provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/notion.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
