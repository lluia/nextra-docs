## Environment Variables

<Callout>
  For consistency, we recommend prefixing all Auth.js environment variables with
  `AUTH_`. This way we can better autodetect them, and they can also be
  distinguished from other environment variables more easily.
</Callout>

Auth.js libraries require you to set an `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable. This is used to encrypt cookies and tokens. It should be a random string of at least 32 characters. On Unix based systems you can use this command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

or https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 to generate a random value for it.

If you are using an [OAuth Provider](/reference/oauth-providers), your provider will have a

{" "}

<ins>Client ID</ins> and <ins>Client Secret</ins> that you will need to set as environment
variables as well (in the case of OIDC, a third `issuer` might be also required,
refer to the provider's setup). Auth.js now supports [environment variable inference](#TODO).

#### `AUTH_TRUST_HOST`

When deploying your application behind a reverse proxy, you'll need to set `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` equal
to `true`. Some hosting providers, like Vercel, will do this for you.

#### `AUTH_URL`

#### `AUTH_SECRET`

#### `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL`

## Serverless

Hosting services like Vercel and Netlify are great for deploying apps with Auth.js authentication. The following steps should help you get started:

1. Create the required [environment variables](#environment-variables) for the desired deploy environments.
2. In the case of an OAuth provider, set the callback URL for the provider to `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/provider` (replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain and `provider` with the provider name, eg.: `github`).
3. Deploy!

You can check out example serverless deployments [here](/docs#examples).

## Self-hosted

Auth.js can also be deployed anywhere you can deploy the framework of your choice. Check out the framework's documentation on self-hosting.

## Securing a preview deployment

Most OAuth providers cannot be configured with multiple callback URLs or using a wildcard.

However, Auth.js **supports Preview deployments**, even **with OAuth providers**:

1. Determine a stable deployment URL. Eg.: A deployment whose URL does not change between builds, for example. `auth.yourdomain.com` (using a subdomain is not a requirement, this can be the main site's URL too, for example.)
2. Set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to that stable deployment URL, including the path from where Auth.js handles the routes. Eg.: (`https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth`)
3. For your OAuth provider, set the callback URL using the stable deployment URL. Eg.: For GitHub `https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/github`)

Fun fact: all of our example apps mentioned above are using the proxy functionality!

<Callout type="info">
  To support preview deployments, the `AUTH_SECRET` value needs to be the same
  for the stable deployment and deployments that will need OAuth support.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you are storing users in a [database](/reference/core/adapters), we
  recommend using a different OAuth app for development/production so that you
  don't mix your test and production user base.
</Callout>

<b>How does this work?</b>
</summary>
To support preview deployments, Auth.js requires a deployment URL that is stable across deploys as a redirect proxy server.

It will redirect the OAuth callback request to the preview deployment URL, but only when the `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` environment variable is set.

When a user initiates an OAuth sign-in flow on a preview deployment, we save its URL in the `state` query parameter but set the `redirect_uri` to the stable deployment.

Then, the OAuth provider will redirect the user to the stable URL mentioned above, which will verify the `state` parameter and redirect the user to the preview deployment URL if the `state` is valid. This is secured by relying on the same server-side `AUTH_SECRET` for the stable deployment and the preview deployment.
