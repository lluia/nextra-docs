# Configuring an OAuth provider

For built-in providers, in most cases [you will only need to specify the `clientId` and `clientSecret`](/concepts/environment-variables#oauth-variables), and in case of OIDC (Open ID) providers, the `issuer` property.

If you need to override any of the defaults, you can add them in the provider's function call and they will be deeply-merged with the default configuration options.

<Callout type="info">
  The [provided config
  options](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/oauth.ts#L110-L232)
  for your provider are deeply merged with the default options. That means you
  only have to override part of the options that you need to be different. For
  example if you want different scopes, overriding `authorization.params.scope`
  is enough, instead of the whole `authorization` option.
</Callout>

For example, to override a provider's default scopes, you can do the following:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Auth0 from "next-auth/providers/auth0";

export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
  auth,
} = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Auth0({
      issuer: process.env.ISSUER,
      authorization: { params: { scope: "openid your_custom_scope" } },
    }),
  ],
});
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

Another example, the `profile` callback will return `id`, `name`, `email` and `picture` by default, but you might want to return more information from the provider. After setting the correct scopes, you can then do something like this:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Auth0 from "next-auth/providers/auth0";

export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
  auth,
} = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Auth0({
      profile(profile) {
        return {
          // Return all the profile information you need.
          // The only truly required field is `id`
          // to be able identify the account when added to a database
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

An example of how to enable automatic account linking:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google";

export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
  auth,
} = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>
