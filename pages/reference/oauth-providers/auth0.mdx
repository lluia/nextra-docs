## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Start by creating a Auth.js config file in the root of your application:

<Tabs items={["Next.js", "Sveltekit", "SolidStart"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Auth0 from "next-auth/providers/auth0";
 
export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
  auth,
} = NextAuth({
  providers: [Auth0],
});
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
_Sveltekit not documented yet._
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
_Solidstart documented yet._
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that, if you haven't done it before, setting up OAuth from scratch can be
  tricky. <u>We strongly recommend</u> you read our deep dive guide on [how to
  setup Github OAuth with Auth.js](/tutorials/oauth-github-setup). The
  instructions will be the same for any OAuth provider, only differing how you
  register your application in the provider's dashboard.
</Callout>

If you run the app, this won't work yet. You need to register your application in the OAuth provider dashboard. For instance, for Github you would need to follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) to register the app.

When registering, make sure you insert a callback URL with the following shape:

```
[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]
```

In this case, given we want to try our application locally, it would be (the provider's name is always in [kebab case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case)):

```
https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/auth0
```

Once registered, you should get a clientId and clientSecret. Add those in your application environment file (`.env.local` for Next.js) like so:

```bash filename=".env.local"
AUTH_AUTH0_ID={clientId}
AUTH_AUTH0_SECRET={clientSecret}
```

Auth.js is automatically configured to read these, so you don't need to make any changes in your configuration file.

- [Auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate)

### Notes

The Auth0 provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/auth0.ts). To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

## üóÉÔ∏è API Spec

### Parameters

‚ñ™ **config**: `OIDCUserConfig`\<[`Auth0Profile`](auth0.md#auth0profile)\>

### Returns

[`OIDCConfig`](oauth.md#oidcconfigprofile)\<[`Auth0Profile`](auth0.md#auth0profile)\>

### Auth0Profile

The returned user profile from Auth0 when using the [profile callback](/). [Reference](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/user-profile-structure).

```ts
interface Auth0Profile extends Record<string, any> {
  /* Custom fields that store info about a user that influences the user's access, such as support plan, security roles (if not using the Authorization Core feature set), or access control groups. To learn more, read Metadata Overview. */
  app_metadata: Record<string, any>;
  /* Indicates whether the user has been blocked. Importing enables subscribers to ensure that users remain blocked when migrating to Auth0. */
  blocked: boolean;
  /* Timestamp indicating when the user profile was first created.*/
  created_at: Date;
  /* (unique) The user's email address. */
  email: string;
  /* Indicates whether the user has verified their email address. */
  email_verified: boolean;
  /* The user's family name. */
  family_name: string;
  /* The user's given name. */
  given_name: string;
  /* Contains info retrieved from the identity provider with which the user originally authenticates. Users may also link their profile to multiple identity providers; those identities will then also appear in this array. The contents of an individual identity provider object varies by provider. In some cases, it will also include an API Access Token to be used with the provider. */
  identities: object[];
  /* IP address associated with the user's last login. */
  last_ip: string;
  /* Timestamp indicating when the user last logged in. If a user is blocked and logs in, the blocked session updates last_login. If you are using this property from inside a Rule using the user< object, its value will be associated with the login that triggered the rule; this is because rules execute after login. */
  last_login: Date;
  /* Timestamp indicating the last time the user's password was reset/changed. At user creation, this field does not exist. This property is only available for Database connections. */
  last_password_reset: Date;
  /* Number of times the user has logged in. If a user is blocked and logs in, the blocked session is counted in logins_count.
   */
  logins_count: number;
  /* List of multi-factor providers with which the user is enrolled. */
  multifactor: string;
}
```

## üìò Help

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
