## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install next-auth @auth/sequelize-adapter sequelize
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You'll also have to manually install [the driver for your
  database](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) of choice.
</Callout>

## Setup

### Configuring Auth.js

Add this adapter to your `pages/api/[...nextauth].js` next-auth configuration object.

```javascript filename="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter";
import { Sequelize } from "sequelize";

// https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html#connecting-to-a-database
const sequelize = new Sequelize("yourconnectionstring");

// For more information on each option (and a full list of options) go to
// https://authjs.dev/reference/core#authconfig
export default NextAuth({
  // https://authjs.dev/reference/providers/
  providers: [],
  adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize),
});
```

### Updating the database schema

By default, the sequelize adapter will not create tables in your database. In production, best practice is to create the [required tables](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/adapters/models) in your database via [migrations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html). In development, you are able to call [`sequelize.sync()`](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#model-synchronization) to have sequelize create the necessary tables, foreign keys and indexes:

> This schema is adapted for use in Sequelize and based upon our main [schema](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/adapters#models)

```ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter";
import Sequelize from "sequelize";

const sequelize = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:");
const adapter = SequelizeAdapter(sequelize);

// Calling sync() is not recommended in production
sequelize.sync();

export default NextAuth({
  adapter,
});
```

## Advanced usage

### Using custom models

Sequelize models are option to customization like so:

```ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import SequelizeAdapter, { models } from "@auth/sequelize-adapter";
import Sequelize, { DataTypes } from "sequelize";

const sequelize = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:");

export default NextAuth({
  // https://authjs.dev/reference/providers/
  providers: [],
  adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize, {
    models: {
      User: sequelize.define("user", {
        ...models.User,
        phoneNumber: DataTypes.STRING,
      }),
    },
  }),
});
```
