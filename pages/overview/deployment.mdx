# Deployment

<Callout type="info">
  Auth.js relies strictly on standard Web APIs, so it can be deployed anywhere
  you can deploy a JavaScript application.
</Callout>

## Environment Variables

<Callout>
  For consistency, we recommend prefixing all Auth.js environment variables with
  `AUTH_`. This way we can better autodetect them, and they can also be
  distinguished from other environment variables more easily.
</Callout>

Auth.js libraries require you to set an `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable. This is used to encrypt cookies and tokens. It should be a random string of at least 32 characters. On Unix based systems you can use this command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

or https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 to generate a random value for it.

If you are using an [OAuth Provider](/reference/oauth-providers), your provider will have a <ins>Client ID</ins> and <ins>Client Secret</ins> that you will need to set as environment variables as well (in the case of OIDC, a third `issuer` might be also required, refer to the provider's setup).

<Callout type="info">
  Some Auth.js libraries can infer environment variables without passing them
  explicitly. For example, `next-auth` can infer the `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`
  and `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` environment variables as the `clientId` and
  `clientSecret` options of the OAuth provider. See the API reference for your
  framework to learn more about this feature.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  When deploying your app outside <strong>Vercel</strong>, you'll need to set
  also a `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` variable to `true` for other hosting providers like
  <strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong> or <strong>Netlify</strong>.
</Callout>

### Managing environments

It's normal to run and test your application in different environments. Usually, you'll have a development environment (when you run the application locally on your machine), a staging environment (for your team members to try the application), and a production environment (where your users interact with it).

For OAuth, it's advised to [register a different OAuth application](/setup/oauth-authentication#registering-our-app-in-github) for each environment for the callback URL to redirect to the correct environment. Some OAuth providers allow to have multiple callback URLs per registered application.

## Serverless

Hosting services like Vercel and Netlify are great for deploying apps with Auth.js authentication. The following steps should help you get started:

1. Create the required [environment variables](#environment-variables) for the desired deploy environments.
2. In the case of an OAuth provider, set the callback URL for the provider to `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/provider` (replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain and `provider` with the provider name, eg.: `github`).
3. Deploy!

## Self-hosted

Auth.js can also be deployed anywhere you can deploy the framework of your choice. Check out the framework's documentation on self-hosting.

## Securing a preview deployment

Most OAuth providers cannot be configured with multiple callback URLs or using a wildcard.

However, Auth.js **supports Preview deployments**, even **with OAuth providers**:

1. Determine a stable deployment URL. Eg.: A deployment whose URL does not change between builds, for example. `auth.yourdomain.com` (using a subdomain is not a requirement, this can be the main site's URL too, for example.)
2. Set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to that stable deployment URL, including the path from where Auth.js handles the routes. Eg.: (`https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth`)
3. For your OAuth provider, set the callback URL using the stable deployment URL. Eg.: For GitHub `https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/github`)

<Callout type="info">
  To support preview deployments, the `AUTH_SECRET` value needs to be the same
  for the stable deployment and deployments that will need OAuth support.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note">
  If you are storing users in a [database](/reference/core/adapters), we
  recommend using a different OAuth app for development/production so that you
  don't mix your test and production user base.
</Callout>

<b>How does this work?</b>
</summary>
To support preview deployments, Auth.js uses the stable deployment URL as a redirect proxy server.

It will redirect the OAuth callback request to the preview deployment URL, but only when the `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` environment variable is set. The stable deployment can still act as a regular app.

When a user initiates an OAuth sign-in flow on a preview deployment, we save its URL in the `state` query parameter but set the `redirect_uri` to the stable deployment.

Then, the OAuth provider will redirect the user to the stable deployment, which will verify the `state` parameter and redirect the user to the preview deployment URL if the `state` is valid. This is secured by relying on the same server-side `AUTH_SECRET` for the stable deployment and the preview deployment.
