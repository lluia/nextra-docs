# 42School Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/42-school
```

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_42_SCHOOL_ID
AUTH_42_SCHOOL_SECRET
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import 42School from "next-auth/providers/42-school"

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [42School],
})
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit"
import 42School from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/42-school"

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = SvelteKitAuth(request, {
  providers: [42School],
})
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express"
import 42School from "@auth/express/providers/42-school"

app.use("/auth/*",
  ExpressAuth({ providers: [ 42School ] })
)
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Notes

<Callout>
  42 returns a field on `Account` called `created_at` which is a number. See the
  [docs](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/guides/getting_started#make-basic-requests).
  Make sure to add this field to your database schema, in case if you are using
  an [Adapter](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/adapters).
</Callout>

By default, Auth.js assumes that the 42School provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout type="tip">
  The 42School provider comes with a [default
  configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/42-school.ts).
  To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in
  OAuth
  provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).
</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).
Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for
any deviation from the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem
is non-compliance with the spec, we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for
more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
