# Salesforce Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/saleforce
```

### Configuration

```js
import Auth from "@auth/core";
import SaleForce from "@auth/core/providers/saleforce";

const request = new Request(origin);
const response = await Auth(request, {
  providers: [
    SaleForce({
      clientId: SALEFORCE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: SALEFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Resources

- [SaleForce OAuth documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm&type=5)

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the SaleForce provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout>

The SaleForce provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/saleforce.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
