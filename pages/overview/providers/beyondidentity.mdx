# Beyond Identity Provider

## Setup

```ts
import { Auth } from "@auth/core";
import BeyondIdentity from "@auth/core/providers/beyondidentity";

const request = new Request(origin);
const response = await Auth(request, {
  providers: [
    BeyondIdentity({
      clientId: BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET,
      issuer: BEYOND_IDENTITY_ISSUER,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the BeyondIdentity provider is
based on the [OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) specification.

<Callout type="info">

The BeyondIdentity provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/beyondidentity.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
