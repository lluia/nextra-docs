# About Auth.js

Auth.js is a complete open-source authentication solution for web applications.<br />Check out the live demos of Auth.js in action:

<DemoCards />

Support for more frameworks are on the way, check the [integrations page](/overview/integrations)
for all supported packages!

## What is Auth.js?

NextAuth.js has been re-architected and rebranded as **Auth.js**. NextAuth.js was initially born as
an authentication library for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). With v5 we took a step back and
refactored the whole library to be an authentication layer which is framework agnostic.A

Auth.js stays as a core JS authentication layer which can be used in any
framework (using the specific package for the framework). [Have a look at our history](/overview/contributors#history) on why NextAuth.js was rebranded to Auth.js.

## Authentication methods

There are 3 ways to authenticate users with Auth.js:

- [OAuth authentication](/getting-started/providers/oauth-tutorial) ( _Sign in with Google, Github, LinkedIn, etc..._ )
- [Token-based authentication](/getting-started/providers/email-tutorial) ( _Magic links, OTP codes, etc..._ )
- [Credentials](/getting-started/providers/credentials-tutorial) ( _Integrating with external APIs,
  WebAuthn, etc..._ )

### Official Providers

<ListDisclosure limit={8}>
  {Object.entries(manifest.providers).map(([id, name]) => (
    <Link
      href={`/reference/core/providers/${id}`}
      key={name}
      className="p-4 border border-solid dark:border-neutral-800 border-slate-200 rounded-lg flex flex-col items-center justify-between w-36 shadow-lg h-32"
    >
      <img src={`/img/providers/${id}.svg`} className="w-11 mt-2" />
      <div className="text-sm text-center">{name}</div>
    </Link>
  ))}
</ListDisclosure>

### Supported Databases

Optionally, Auth.js can be integrated with an external database via Database adapters, in case you need or want to store user data.

<ListDisclosure limit={8}>
  {Object.entries(manifest.adapters).map(([value, label]) => (
    <Link
      href={`/reference/adapter/${value}`}
      key={value}
      className="p-4 border border-solid dark:border-neutral-800 border-slate-200 rounded-lg flex flex-col items-center justify-between w-36 shadow-lg h-32"
    >
      <img src={`/img/adapters/${value}.svg`} className="h-12 mt-2" />
      <div className="text-sm text-center">{label}</div>
    </Link>
  ))}
</ListDisclosure>
