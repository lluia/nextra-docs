## Donations

Maintaining Auth.js as an open source project is very hard work. All the core team members have regular jobs and the library is maintained and developed out of good will in our free time. Donations can enable the core team to eventually work full time on Auth.js to provide more features and an even better developer experience.

## Other contributors

Auth.js as it exists today has been possible thanks to the work of many individual contributors.

Thank you to the [dozens of individual contributors](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/graphs/contributors) who have helped shape Auth.js.

## History

<Steps>

### 2016 â€“ Initial release

NextAuth.js was originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/iaincollins">Iain Collins</a> in 2016 as an authentication framework just for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

### 2020 â€“ Refactor and clean up

NextAuth.js was rebuilt from the ground up to support serverless, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, JSON Web Tokens and built-in support for over a dozen authentication providers.

### 2021 â€“ Multi-framework effort

Efforts started to move NextAuth.js to other frameworks and to support as many databases and providers as possible.

### 2022 â€“ ðŸŒŸ Birth of Auth.js

Auth.js was born which separated the core authentication logic from the Next.js framework and added support for any new frameworks.
