# Installing Auth.js

Installing Auth.js is easy, you just need to run a single command and set one environment variable.

Start by installing the appropriate package for your framework of choice:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["Next.js", "Sveltekit", "SolidStart"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install next-auth
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install @auth/sveltekit
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install @auth/solid-start
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
{/* prettier-ignore */}

## Environment

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your application and add the `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable:

```bash filename=".env.local"
AUTH_SECRET="This is an example"
```

`AUTH_SECRET` is a random token used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes, and it's mandatory to keep things secure (See [Deployment](/deployment) to learn more). On Unix based systems you can use this command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

or you can visit https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 to generate one.

<Callout type="warning">
  When deploying your app outside <strong>Vercel</strong>, you'll need to set
  also a `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` variable to `true` for other hosting providers like
  <strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong> or <strong>Netlify</strong>.
