<Steps>
### Installing Auth.js

Installing Auth.js is straightforward, you should only to need to run a single command and set one environment variable.

Start by installing the appropriate package for your framework of choice:

<Code>
  <Code.Next>
    
    ```bash
    npm install next-auth
    ```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>
  
    ```bash
    npm install @auth/sveltekit
    ```
  </Code.Svelte>
  {/* <Code.Solid>
  
    ```bash
    npm install @auth/solid-start
    ```
  
  </Code.Solid> */}
  <Code.Express>
  
    ```bash
    npm install @auth/express
    ```
  
  </Code.Express>
</Code>

<Callout type="info">
  As a consumer of the library, you should never need to install the
  `@auth/core` package
</Callout>

### Setup Environment

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your application and add the `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable:

```bash filename=".env.local"
AUTH_SECRET="This is an example"
```

`AUTH_SECRET` is a random token used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes, and it's mandatory to keep things secure (See [Deployment](/getting-started/deployment) to learn more). On Unix based systems you can use this command:

  </Code.Next>
</Code>

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

or you can visit https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 to generate one.

### Initialise Auth.js

The most important part of your Auth.js project is the Auth.js config object. There you can control
the behaviour of the library and specify custom authentication logic, adapters, etc.

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

Start by creating a new `auth.ts` file at the root of your app with the following content:

<Callout type="info">
  You can actually name the file however you want and place it wherever you
  like. Make sure you place it's easy to reference via imports, as we'll be
  using its 3 main exports: `signIn`, `signOut` and `auth`.
</Callout>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [],
});
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="./src/hooks.server.ts"
import { SvelteKitAuth } from "@auth/sveltekit";

export const handle = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [],
});
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  {/* <Code.Solid>

```ts filename="./routes/api/auth/[...solidauth].ts"
import { SolidAuth, type SolidAuthConfig } from "@auth/solid-start"

export const authOpts: SolidAuthConfig = {
  providers: [],
}

export const { GET, POST } = SolidAuth(authOpts)
```

  </Code.Solid> */}
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="./src/routes/auth.route.ts"
import { ExpressAuth } from "@auth/express";
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// Make sure to use these body parsers so Auth.js can receive data from the client
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// If app is served through a proxy, trust the proxy to allow HTTPS protocol to be detected
app.use("trust proxy");

app.use(
  "/api/auth/*",
  ExpressAuth({
    providers: [],
  })
);
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Setup Authentication Methods

With that the basic setup is complete! If you need a database go on to the next page, otherwise you
can skip on to the next section, [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication), to setup your first authentication method.
