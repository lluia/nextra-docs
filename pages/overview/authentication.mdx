# Authenticating users

<Callout type="warning">
  Auth.js discourages the use of passwords due to the inherent security risks of
  the username-password model. Passwords are still supported through the
  <strong>CredentialsProvider</strong> but we strongly encourage to setup a combination
  of Oauth and Passwordless for authentication.
</Callout>

Before start setting up Auth.js, you need to decide how you're gonna authenticate users in your application. Auth.js supports <u>three main authentication paradigms</u>:

- **OAuth** ( _Sign in with Google, Github, LinkedIn, etc..._ )
- **Paswordless** ( _Magic links, OTP codes, WebAuthn, etc..._ )
- **External Auth** ( _Integrating with external APIs, etc..._ )

<details>
<summary>
<b>Why Auth.js recommends OAuth as the main authentication method for your application?</b>
</summary>

OAuth providers spend significant amounts of money, time, and engineering effort to build abuse detection ( _bot-protection, rate-limiting_ ), password management ( _password reset, credential stuffing, rotation_ ), data security ( _encryption/salting, strength validation_ ), and much more. It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.

<details>
<summary>
<b>Do I need a database?</b>
</summary>

Auth.js by default uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) for saving the user's session so you don't need to setup a database for authenticating users ( _all our JWT tokens are encrypted by default with A256GCM_ ). However, if you want to set up a database, you can use one of our official database adapters or create your own. The database will be used <u>to persist the user's session</u>. You can force the usage of JWT when using a database through the configuration options.

<summary>
<b>Can I set up more than one authentication method?</b>
</summary>

OAuth providers spend significant amounts of money, time, and engineering effort to build abuse detection ( _bot-protection, rate-limiting_ ), password management ( _password reset, credential stuffing, rotation_ ), data security ( _encryption/salting, strength validation_ ), and much more. It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.

Once you have chosen your authentication method, refer to one of the sections below on how you set it up:

- [Setting up Oauth](#setting-up-oauth)
- [Setting up Paswordless](#setting-up-paswordless)
- [Setting up external auth](#setup-with-external-auth)

## Setting up OAuth

<Callout type="info">
  Can't find the OAuth provider you're looking for? In that case, you'll need to
  build your own provider, which is easy. [Learn how](/tutorials/custom-oauth)
  to do so. Technically, Auth.js can be set with any OAuth provider as long as
  they support **OAuth 2**.
</Callout>

Auth.js has built-in support for a lot of OAuth providers, you can see the full list below and click in one of them to learn how to configure it.

<ListDisclosure limit={8}>
  {Object.entries(manifest.providers).map(([id, name]) => (
    <Link
      href={`/reference/core/providers/${id}`}
      key={name}
      className="p-4 border border-solid border-slate-200 rounded-lg flex flex-col items-center justify-between w-36 shadow-lg h-32"
    >
      <img src={`/img/providers/${id}.svg`} className="w-11 mt-2" />
      <div class="text-sm text-center">{name}</div>
    </Link>
  ))}
</ListDisclosure>

Start by creating a Auth.js config file in the root of your application:

<Tabs items={["Next.js", "Sveltekit", "SolidStart"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
// In this example we're using Github, if you're using another provider, for example, like Google, it'll be:
// `import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"`
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github";
 
export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
  auth,
} = NextAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
});
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
_Sveltekit not documented yet._
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
_Solidstart documented yet._
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that, if you haven't done it before, setting up OAuth from scratch can be
  tricky. <u>We strongly recommend</u> you read our deep dive guide on [how to
  setup Github OAuth with Auth.js](/tutorials/oauth-github-setup). The
  instructions will be the same for any OAuth provider, only differing how you
  register your application in the provider's dashboard.
</Callout>

If you run the app, this won't work yet. You need to register your application in the OAuth provider dashboard. For instance, for Github you would need to follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) to register the app.

When registering, make sure you insert a callback URL with the following shape:

```
[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]
```

In this case, given we want to try our application locally, it would be (the provider's name is always in [kebab case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case)):

```
https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
```

Once registered, you should get a `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`. Add those in your application environment file (`.env.local` for Next.js) like so:

```bash filename=".env.local"
GITHUB_ID={CLIENT_ID}
GITHUB_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}
```

Auth.js is automatically configured to read these, so you don't need to make any changes in your configuration file. The shape of these variables in the environment is always the sale:

```
{PROVIDER-NAME}_ID=
{PROVIDER-NAME}_SECRET=
```
