# Setup a database

Setting up a database in optional. Auth.js by default uses JSON Web Tokens for saving the user's session so you don't need to setup a database for authenticating users. However, if you want to persist user information in your own database, or you want to implement certain flows, you can use a **Database Adapter**.

**Database Adapters** are packages maintained by the Auth.js team to connect Auth.js to the most common databases (see full list below).

For instance, [when implementing magic links](/tutorials/paswordless-sentry-setup), the `EmailProvider` will require you to setup a database adapter to be able to store the [verification tokens](/concepts/database-models#verificationtoken-model) present on the links.

## Official adapters

Below you can see a list of official adapters that are distributed as their own packages under the `@auth/{name}-adapter` namespace. Their source code is available in their various adapters package directories at [`nextauthjs/next-auth`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/packages)

<Callout type="warning">
  If you're gonna setup a database, make sure you familiarise yourself [with the
  models Auth.js](/concepts/database-models) expects to be present.

  If you don't find an adapter for the database or service you use, you can
  always create one yourself (and optionally open a PR so anyone can make use of
  it). Have a look at our guide on [how to create a database
  adapter](/tutorials/custom-adapter).
