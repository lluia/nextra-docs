# Framework Integrations

The Auth.js team is working hard to create a framework agnostic authentication engine that runs on all major Front-end frameworks.

In the following table you can see the _state_ of planned and released packages under the `@auth/*` and `@next-auth/*` scope, as well as `next-auth`. This is not an exhaustive list, but the set of packages that we would like to focus on, to begin with.

  framework integration by [following this guide](/).

<Callout type="info">
  Note that because of preventing breaking changes on package imports,
  `next-auth` is the only framework package which is not named following the
  `@auth/*` convention. This library initially was born as `next-auth` but [over
  the years has evolved](/overview/contributors#history) to be framework
  agnostic.

### Help needed

In case you are a maintainer of a package that uses `@auth/core`, feel free to [reach out to Bal√°zs](https://twitter.com/balazsorban44), if you want to collaborate on making it an official package, maintained in our repository. If you are interested in bringing `@auth/core` support to your favorite framework, we would love to hear from you!

#### Community Packages

While we are migrating the documentation and working on stabilizing the core package, the community has been working on some packages that are already available. With collaboration, we hope to make these packages official in the future.
