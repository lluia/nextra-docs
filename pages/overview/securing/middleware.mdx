# Middleware (Next.js)

With NextAuth.js 4.2.0 and Next.js 12, you can now protect your pages via the middleware pattern more easily. If you would like to protect all pages, you can create a `_middleware.ts` file in your root pages directory which looks like this:

```ts filename="./middleware.ts"
export { default } from "next-auth/middleware";
```

Otherwise, if you only want to protect a subset of pages, you could put it in a subdirectory as well, for example in `/app/admin/_middleware.ts` would protect all pages under the `/admin` route.

For the time being, middleware only supports **jwt** as a session strategy, so it won't work with databases.

## 🍜 Recipes

### Redirecting users

You can extend the default `withAuth` middleware to redirect users depending on certain conditions, for example their role:

```ts
import { withAuth } from "next-auth/middleware";

export default withAuth(
  // `withAuth` augments your `Request` with the user's token.
  function middleware(req) {
    console.log(req.nextauth.token);
  },
  {
    callbacks: {
      authorized: ({ token }) => token?.role === "admin",
    },
  }
);

export const config = { matcher: ["/admin"] };
```
