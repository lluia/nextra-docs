# OAuth authentication

The fastest way to set up Auth.js is with an [OAuth provider](/concepts/oauth). In this tutorial, we'll be setting Auth.js in a Next.js application to be able to log in with **GitHub**.

<Callout>
  Auth.js comes with a list of [built-in OAuth
  providers](/reference/oauth-providers) (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). You
  can also integrate with your custom OAuth provider by [building your
  own](/guides/providers/custom-provider).
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  This tutorial uses Github as the OAuth provider. Note that, for any OAuth
  provider, the process will be the same, only differing on how you register
  your application in the chosen provider's dashboard.
</Callout>

## Overview

<Steps>
### Setting up Auth.js
 
Initial configuration of our Next.js application to work with Auth.js

### Registering our app in Github

Registering our application in Github by creating an OAuth app and getting its ID and secret.

### Wiring all together

Using the ID and secret from the registered app, wiring all together in our Next.js app so that we can enable users to sign in with Github.

</Steps>

## Setting up Auth.js

### Installing Auth.js and Next.js

For this tutorial, we're gonna use the default [Auth.js & Next.js example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example). If you already have an existing Next.js app, it should work too. If you haven't, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git && cd next-auth-example
```

If you're using the example app, Auth.js is already installed, otherwise follow the [installation instructions](/installation).

### Creating the server config

Next, we're gonna create the main Auth.js configuration file (which is a Next.js API route). This route contains the necessary configuration for Auth.js, as well as the dynamic route handler:

```ts filename="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import GithubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github";

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
});
```

Behind the scenes, this creates all the relevant Auth API routes within `/api/auth/*` so that your application can interact with the chosen OAuth provider using the [OAuth 2](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2) protocol.

- See all the OAuth Provider configuration options 🔗

### Adding environment variables

You may notice we are using environment variables in the code example above. If you haven't, create an `.env.local` file as explained in the [installation section](/installation) and add the following two variables:

```bash filename=".env.local"
GITHUB_ID="123"
GITHUB_SECRET="123"
```

We will be filling `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET` with proper values from the GitHub Developer Portal once we have registered our application in Github.

## Registering our app

### Creating an OAuth app in Github

We need to register our application in GitHub, so that when NextAuth.js forwards the authorization requests to it, GitHub can recognize your application and authenticate the user for us.

Log in [to GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers), go to **Settings** → **Developers** → **OAuth Apps** and click "New OAuth App":

<img src="/img/oauth-setup/creating-oauth-app.png" />

Next, you'll be presented with a screen to register your application. Fill in all the required fields:

<img src="/img/oauth-setup/callback-url.png" />

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
The callback URL we provide should have the following shape:

```
[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]
```

For us, given we want to try our authentication <ins>working locally</ins> on our machine and we're using <ins>GitHub</ins> as our authentication provider, it'll be:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
```

</Callout>

Note that, because we're using Next.js, when running the app locally it starts our server on port `3000` by default. Hence, the origin is `http://localhost:3000`.

The last part of the URL, `[provider]`, is the ID of the provider you're using. In this case, we're using GitHub, so it's `github`. If you're using Google, it'll be `google`. The ID of the provider is its name [in kebab case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case).

<img src="/img/oauth-setup/clientid-secret.png" />

### Getting secrets

Once created, the next screen shows all the configurations for our app.

We need 2 things from this screen, the <ins>Client ID</ins> and <ins>Client Secret</ins>.

The Client ID is always there, a public identifier of your OAuth application within GitHub.

For the Client Secret, click on the "Generate a new client Secret" and you will be presented with a new string (which is just a randomized string).

<Callout>
  Keep both your <ins>Client ID</ins> and <ins>Client Secret</ins> secure and
  never expose them to the public or share them with people outside your
  organization.
</Callout>

We have finished configuring our OAuth provider, now let's wire all together so we can finally authenticate our users through Github.

## Wiring all together

Let's paste both the <ins>Client ID</ins> and <ins>Client Secret</ins> created in the previous section into our app's environment file:

```bash filename=".env.local"
GITHUB_ID={CLIENT_ID}
GITHUB_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}
```

Finally, we're ready to run our application locally.

Start the Next.js app:

```
npm run next dev
```

And navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see the following page:

<img src="/img/oauth-setup/app-start.png" />

Click on "Sign in" and then on "Sign in with GitHub".

Auth.js will redirect you to GitHub, and GitHub will recognize our app (that we just registered), asking the user to enter its credentials to proceed:

<img src="/img/oauth-setup/github-auth-credentials.png" />

Once authenticated, GitHub will redirect the user back to our app and Auth.js will take care of the rest:

<img src="/img/oauth-setup/github-auth-success.png" />

Great! We have completed the whole end-to-end authentication flow so that users can log in to our application via GitHub!

<Callout type="info">
  As you can see, most of the time required setting up OAuth in our application
  is spent registering our application in the OAuth provider's dashboard (some
  are easier to navigate, some are harder 😭). Once registered, the setup via
  Auth.js is then really easy.
</Callout>

## Deployment

Before we can release our app to production, we'll need to change a few things.

You'll need to register a separate application in Github's dashboard [as we did here](/setup/oauth-authentication#registering-our-app-in-github) but setting up the Callback URL host to your application's domain (.i.e `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/github`). You'll then have a new <ins>Client ID</ins> and <ins>Client Secret</ins> that will be added via environment variables in your production environment.

Refer to the [Deployment page](/deployment) for more information.
