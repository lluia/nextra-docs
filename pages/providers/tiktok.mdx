```

import Auth from "@auth/core";
import Tiktok from "@auth/core/providers/tiktok";

- [Tiktok login kit documentation](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-web/)
- [Avaliable Scopes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-scopes/)

### Notes

Production applications cannot use localhost URLs to sign in with Tiktok. You need add the domain and Callback/Redirect url's to your Tiktok app and have them review and approved by the Tiktok Team.

<Callout type="warning">

Email address is not supported by Tiktok.

</Callout>

Client_ID will be the Client Key in the Tiktok Application

By default, Auth.js assumes that the Tiktok provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout>
The Tiktok provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/tiktok.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
