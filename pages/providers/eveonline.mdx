### Notes

<Callout type="info">
  When creating your application, make sure to select `Authentication Only` as
  the connection type.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
If using JWT for the session, you can add the `CharacterID` to the JWT and session. Example:

```js
options: {
  jwt: {
    secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  },
  callbacks: {
    session: async ({ session, token }) => {
      session.user.id = token.id;
      return session;
    }
  }
}
```

</Callout>

By default, Auth.js assumes that the EveOnline provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

The EveOnline provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/eveonline.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
