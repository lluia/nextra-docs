### Setup

#### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/descope
```

#### Configuration

Import the provider and configure it in your **Auth.js** initialization file:

```ts filename="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import DescopeProvider from "next-auth/providers/descope";

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    DescopeProvider({
      clientId: process.env.DESCOPE_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.DESCOPE_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Configuring Descope

Follow these steps:

1. Log into the [Descope console](https://app.descope.com)
2. Follow the [OIDC instructions](https://docs.descope.com/customize/auth/oidc)

Then, create a `.env.local` file in the project root add the following entries:

Get the following from the Descope's console:

```
DESCOPE_ID="<Descope Issuer's last url segment>" # Descope's Issuer can be found in "Authentication Methods > SSO > Identity Provider" (Can also be taken from "Project > Project ID")
DESCOPE_SECRET="<Descope Access Key>" # Manage > Access Keys
```

### Notes

The Descope provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/descope.ts). To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

<Callout type="info">
  By default, Auth.js assumes that the Descope provider is based on the
  [OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) spec
</Callout>

## Help

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
