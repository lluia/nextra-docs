### Notes

<Callout>
  42 returns a field on `Account` called `created_at` which is a number. See the
  [docs](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/guides/getting_started#make-basic-requests).
  Make sure to add this field to your database schema, in case if you are using
  an [Adapter](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/adapters).
</Callout>

By default, Auth.js assumes that the 42School provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout type="tip">
  The 42School provider comes with a [default
  configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/42-school.ts).
  To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in
  OAuth
  provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).
</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).
Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for
any deviation from the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem
is non-compliance with the spec, we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for
more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
