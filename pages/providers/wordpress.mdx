# Wordpress Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```

const response = await Auth(request, {

      clientSecret: WORKPRESS_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Resources

- [WordPress OAuth documentation](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/)

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the WordPress provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout>

The WordPress provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/wordpress.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
