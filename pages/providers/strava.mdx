### Setup

#### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/strava
```

#### Configuration

``js
import Auth from "@auth/core"
import Strava from "@auth/core/providers/strava"

const request = new Request(origin)
const response = await Auth(request, {
providers: [Strava({ clientId: STRAVA_CLIENT_ID, clientSecret: STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET })],
})

```

### Resources

- [Strava API documentation](http://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/)

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the Strava provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

:::tip

The Strava provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/strava.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

:::

:::info **Disclaimer**

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
